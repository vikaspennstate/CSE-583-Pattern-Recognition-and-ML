% Visualizing Boundaries: this is using matlab's internal code
%         you will have to conform it your data structures to use (you
%         don't have to have the same class structure)  You will have to 
%         change the predict function for your own code. 
%     This is visualizing the linear function defining the class boundaries
%          boundaries for each class comparison
%    MDlLinear is a matrix of discriminant functions
%    featureVector is the features to show
%    labels are the feature vector labels as a categorical array
%    featureA and FeatureB are the index of the features to visualize
